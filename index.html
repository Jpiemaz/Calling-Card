		<p>Hey Look! It's me wearing an awesome(?) bandana!</p>
		
		<p> I really like tech, outside activities, video games, and pizza. To see some of my favorite sites, click on the pictures below!</p>

		<p> Grantland is one of my favorite blogs to read, Bill Simmons is hilarious, incredibly smart, and a great writer. Most of the site is sports, and he's OBSESSED with basketball, but that's okay cause so am I. Go Knicks! </p>

		<p> I'm a little embarrassed by it, but I love Reddit a lot. I can always count on it for a laugh, it isn't as unpredictable as 4chan, and I just love pictures of cats.</p>

		<p> IGN is where I go for most of my video game news, it's gone a little downhill in recent years, but it's still pretty reliable for highlights</p>

		<p> Speaking of video games, here's a blog I did last year on video games, I've been wanting to continue it, but I haven't had that much time recently.</p>

        <p> I don't really have any good pictures of me doing this, but here's a sweet dude playing Spikeball, which is probably my favorite hobby. Click on him to go to the website and see some awesome videos. </p>
